    <strong>microzord</strong> is a small tool that allows you to add and render multiple
    apps on one page. It has simple ideomatic APIs for all modern frameworks and builds
    bridges between them.

        You can have an Angular application with a React app header and a Vue app footer.
        Each app can have endless amount of nested apps inside. There are also wrappers
        for every modern framework with simple API.

      <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        You can insert another app in your app in any place as an ordinary component. Use
        the same methods to bind data and to handle its events.

    <h2>What it is about</h2>

    <p>There are two terms that we want to declare first:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Child app</strong> is any application that is built with microzord and can
        be inserted into the host app.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Host app</strong> is any application that uses microzord to render child
        apps inside.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <tui-notification class="tui-space_top-6">
      Some application can host any amount of child apps and be a child for other app at
      the same time
    </tui-notification>

    <p>
      Microzord does not impose any restrictions but just gives more opportunities for
      your app. All your apps can be still used as separated apps and can be integrated
      with others with no additional code in application bundle.

    <p>
      It renders your apps right in DOM without any additional elements or iframes and
      provides some ideomatic ways to control apps and get data from them.
